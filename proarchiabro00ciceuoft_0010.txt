8 INTRODUCTION

while Italians from the savoured boroughs found many
induceinents to settle in Rome, those of more harshly-
used communities made it their business to flock thither
in great numbers, wliencver political agitation in the
city gave malcontcnts a hope of making their respective
grievances solt. We find, sor instance, that during the
Gracchan Rovolution a law was passed by M. Junius
Pennus, which, forbidding aliens to settle in Rome, was
really directed against the Italians.

The peninsular agitator, however, was not alone in
exciting the jealousy of the governmcnt. To Romans of
the old republican stamp, of whom Cato the Censor
stands out as the type, the intrusion of Greeks was in
a special degree obnoxious. The enlightened Conqueror
of Macedonia, on the other hand, Lucius Aemilius
Paullus, had his sons trained in the Hellenic wisdom
and literature—a course enthusiastically pursued by that
one of them who became through adoption P. Corn.
Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor, and gathered round
him such famous literary men as the historian Polybius,
the dramatist Terence, the satirist Lucilius, the philoso-
phers Laelius and Panaetius. Against these devoted
exponents of the Greek civilization, mere conservatism
could do nothing ; while the entirelyjustifiable mistrust‚
which Cato and his followers entertained sor Hellenism
in its baser aspects, did but temporarily stem a tide fated
at last to submerge the primitive Roman saith and morals.
In 161 Β. c. the great Censor induced the Senate to banish
Greek philosophers and rhetoricians: a century later
Cicero's defence of Archias shows us an admirer of Cato
vindicating Letters : before men all of whom, like him-
self, could speak Greek, and not one of whom would
openly have owned to an indifference towards Plato and
the poets.

Aversion from the inroads of speculative thought had
its share in the recurrent dismissal of immigrants ς but
a more cogent reason for expulsion lay in the difficulty
of maintaining law and order at Rome in face of a
growing admixture of foreign ruffianism. Desperadoes
