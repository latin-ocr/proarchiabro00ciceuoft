ALIE NS AT ROME 9

from all parts of tho Empire ssocked to Rome, seeing
their chance in such horrei-s as attended the Sullan 82 nc.
proscription‚ and aeting readily as the tools of sedition.
It was mainly to rid Rome of these pests that, three
years before the prosecution of Archias, the Lex Papia 65 ⁸·C·
was passed, expelling non-burgesses.

Before we leave the subject of these anti-alien acts,
it is necessary to obser-ve that, where an exeeutive lies
in magistracies of annual tenure, such measures tend to
be largely inoperative. Undesirable residents might be
expelled from Rome by statute: their actual ejection
was frequently the result of private enterprise in the law
courts.

The Italian Franchise.

Resereuce has already been made to tre status of
Italians before 89 B.c. The discontent sostei-ed by their
disabilities‚ which reformers like Gracchus and Drusus 126 8.(-
had vainly tried to remove, led to an open revolt 0f91 ”⁰⁰⁶
the central peoples of Ital y. In the year 90, alai-med by The sot-iul
the success and spread of the rebellion, the senate Waor, Ι
endeavoured to check disaffection hy passing the Lex ἶϊζῧιᾟξῃζ
Julia, which granted the sull franchise to such com- 90 B·‘³·
munities as had taken no part in the war, provided that
they formally accepted the offer. For the sew which
already possessed a specially favourable treaty with
Rome, the change had few attractions. It is known that
Heraclea and Neapolis hesitatt d.

The conclusion of the Social War was marked hy
a statute, called Lex Silvani et Carbonis in this speech, [χχ
which extended to individuals the privileges conset-red Plautia
by the Lex Julia on corporate bodies. Applicants were ξέιέ,1(’·’,“’

Italian township possessing a formal treat y with Rome
(civitas foederata).

that the law was passed.
