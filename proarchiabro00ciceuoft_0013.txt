THE CAREER OF ARCHIAS ll

He reached Rome during the consulship of Marius and 102 B-C·
Catulus. The latter—himself of literary tastes, and the
author of a Greek epigram on the actor Roscius which
has survived-—gave him a wclcome. He became the
friend of Q. Metellus Numidicus and his son; and, in
later years, embarked upon a poem celebrating the 63 sc.
former’s successes against Jugurtha. He was also received 109 Β. c.
by L. Crassus and Q. Hortensius,jurists who successively
held that premiership in Roman oratory which they were
destined to yield to Cicero. But the family that most
signally befriended Archias, extending to him a hospitalily
which probably ended only with his life, was that of the
Luculli. Three members of this famous house are
connected with the career of our poet. The head of the
family, L. Licinius Lucullus, father of Lucius and Marcus,
was absent in Sicily when Archias first came to Romo, 102 nc.
He was impeached for malpractices on his return, and
had to retire into exile. It seems probable that he
settled in Heraclea; here, at any rate, at some date
between 101 and 89 B.c., a visit was paid by his son
M. Lucullus, who, accompanied by Archias, had been in
Sicily collecting evidence whcrewith to institute pro--
ceedings against his fatlicr’s accuser.

On his visit to Heraclea much of the present suit
against Archias turns. It is plain that the Luculli
possessed influence there. Not only was the poet made
a burge-ss of the city through the direct interest of
Marcus Lucullus; but, apparently out of compliment to ξ 10,
the family, he thenceforth described himself as a citizen
of Heraclea. Upon the passing of the Lex Plauti-2„ 89 stc,
Papiria, Archias formally claimed to be (1) on the
Heraclean register, (2) domiciled in Rome; and, these
facts being allowed, (3) enrolled himself on the books of
his friend the praetor, Q. Metellus Pius, son of Numidicus,
and noted for his punctilious accuracy. From that date ἓ 9.
until 62 B.c. no question was raised as to the validity of
the Roman citizenship of Archias. He assumed the
Lucullan gentile name of Licinius, He made his will,
took possession of legacies from Roman burgesseS, and
