was mentioned on the Distinguished Service List sent
in to the treasury by L. Lucullus, It was, however, the
case-and the Prosecution seized on the fact—that
Archias· mune did not appear on the census-roll of any
year. 'l'his could not, as Dr. Reid points out, have
invalidated his stzitus; sor it must frequently have
happened that a sull citizen was absent from Rome at
the time of the census. But, in any cnse, the omission
is explained hy Cicero. Immediately aster the passing
of the Lex Julia the census that should have been taken
by Crassus and Caesar-was allowed to drop. And on the
two subsequent occasions when the appointed officere

uui: carried out their task Archias was abroad with L.

Lucullus.

The question tin-n arises: Why was this attempt
made to prove Archias an alien, after twenty-seven
,νοω-δ’ unchallenged enjoyment of the Roman franchise 1>
'she nnswer is to be found in the political situation
of those eventful years. The old rivali-y between
Pompeius and Lucullus· came to a head when the former
was appointed to take over the command against Mithri-
dates. Not only was Pompeius empowered by the Lex
Manilia to debar Lucullus srom completing his work,
but his adherents busied themselves, during his absence
at the seat of war, in intrigues to rob the deposed general
of a richly-deserved triumph. It was not celebrated by
Lucullus until the beginning of the year 63. His
vindictive opponents then instituted this vexatious suit
against Archias; with the sole object, apparently, of
humiliating Lucullus by the expulsion from Rome of an
old friend and professed eulogist. That they were foiled
in this attempt seems certain. Lucullus abandoned
political life; und it is probable that Archias shared,
until his patron's death, the culturcd and luxurious
retirement sor which the name of Lucullus was long
reinembered. The poet is last heard of as alive in the
year 44 nc.
