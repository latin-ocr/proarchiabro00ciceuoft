THE TRIAL 13

The T νῖαῖ.

The case was tried before one of the standing Com-
missions established by Sulla. These chczeslz'ones Pmpeluae
sat under the presidency of a praetor-3 while the jury
were selected from a list of senators, knights, and
tribum· aerarii. A scholiast states that Cicero’s brother,
Quintus, presided on this occasion 3 the date is therefore
fixed as 62 B.c., being the year in which Quintus Cicero
was praetor. The prosecutor was a personage named
Gratius.

The plaintiff's case rested mainly on the fact that the
arehives of Heraclea, having perished during the Social
WVar, were not available as proof that Archias had been
a burgess of that city. 'I'hat the defendant could have
established his claim to the Roman franchise on othei·
grounds is obvious. He was a citizen of Neapolis,v
Rhegium, Tarentum, and Locri. It can only be con-
jectured that: 1he animosity towards Lucullus displayezl
by the Pompeians inspired his adherents with an equally
vehement resolve to defeat the other side on their own
ground. W'e must suppose that Archias felt, not only
his personal pride, but his loyalty to his· patron, to bo
involved in the recognition of that Heraclean citizenship
which the interest of Lucullus had procured sor him.
The attendance in court of that general, accompanied
by a deputation of distinguished persons from Heraclea,
effeetively disposed of the case for the prosecution.
